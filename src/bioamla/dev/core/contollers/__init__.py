Audio Processing Controllers Module

This package contains controller classes that coordinate and manage complex
audio processing workflows. Controllers act as orchestrators that combine
multiple audio processing operations and manage the interaction between
different components of the audio editing system.

The controllers module provides high-level interfaces for:
- Coordinating multi-step audio processing pipelines
- Managing workflow state and progress tracking  
- Handling complex audio editing operations
- Orchestrating interactions between audio processing components

This module serves as the control layer that sits between the user interface
and the core audio processing functionality, providing a clean separation
of concerns and enabling complex audio editing workflows.
