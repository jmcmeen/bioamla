"""
Wildlife Acoustics File Utilities
=================================

This module provides helper functions for working with audio files and metadata
created by Wildlife Acoustics recording hardware. This includes specialized
functions for parsing filenames, extracting metadata, and handling the specific
formats used by Wildlife Acoustics devices.

Note: This module is currently under development with placeholder implementations.
