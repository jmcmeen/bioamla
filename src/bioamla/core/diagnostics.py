"""
Diagnostic information controller for the bioamla package.

This module provides comprehensive diagnostic functionality to retrieve
information about the bioamla package environment, installed dependencies,
and hardware configuration. It serves as a centralized location for
system introspection and troubleshooting support.

The module offers tools to examine package versions, CUDA device availability,
and other runtime environment details that are crucial for debugging and
ensuring proper bioamla functionality across different deployment scenarios.

def get_bioamla_version() -> str:
    """
    Get the current version of the bioamla package.
    
    Retrieves the version information from the package metadata using
    importlib.metadata. This provides the exact version string as defined
    in the package's setup configuration.
    
    Returns:
        str: The version string of the currently installed bioamla package
             (e.g., "0.0.38").

    """
    Get a comprehensive dictionary of all installed packages and their versions.
    
    Scans the current Python environment to retrieve version information for
    all installed packages. This is useful for debugging dependency issues,
    creating reproducible environments, or generating system reports.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, str]: A dictionary mapping package names to their version
                       strings. Keys are package names (e.g., "numpy") and
                       values are version strings (e.g., "1.21.0").
                       
    Example:

        NumPy version: 1.21.0

        The returned dictionary includes all packages in the current Python
        environment, not just bioamla dependencies. For large environments,
        this may return hundreds of packages.

    Examines the current system's GPU configuration through PyTorch's CUDA
    interface. This includes CUDA availability status, device count, current
    active device, and detailed information about each available GPU.
    
    The function is essential for verifying that bioamla can leverage GPU
    acceleration for audio processing tasks and machine learning operations.
